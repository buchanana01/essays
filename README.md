# Stanhopea

In January 1956, the British artist, explorer, and environmentalist Margaret Mee (1909–1988) undertook a dangerous journey deep into the Amazon. Her goal was to document rare Amazonian plants in their natural habitats. This trip would be the first of many for Mee, who carried out a total of fifteen expeditions between 1956 and 1988. Her 1957 orchid painting of Stanhopea graveolens in the Dumbarton Oaks Rare Book Collection is just one example of the many rare and beautiful plant portraits Mee painted.

But just as orchids often do, Mee’s elegant painting carries an air of mystery. Does the painting really depict the Stanhopea graveolens species? And how did orchids like this transform from rare flowers—accessible only after journeying over a thousand miles through inhospitable environments—into popular houseplants you can purchase at your local supermarket?
